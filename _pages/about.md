I am an Economics PhD student at the University of Virginia researching Macroeconomics. 

My current focus is using heterogeneous agent models to answer questions related to inflation, price setting, and decisions over the life-cycle. I also like thinking about ways to credibly apply microeconometric methods in Macro settings.
