  - title: Sticky Interest Rates
    abstract: "Central banks choose to adjust their target on overnight lending rates at a sluggish frequency that logistical costs alone cannot account for. Similar to earlier work on firm price-setting, this paper takes the infrequent adjustment at face value, abstracting from the reasons central bank make this choice, and instead asking what would be the consequences of this practice in a typical framework. I augment an otherwise standard New Keynesian model with interest rate analogues to Calvo and Rotemberg price stickiness and find marked differences in monetary policy transmission relative to a standard Taylor Rule benchmark. The effects mirror documented volatility associated with interest rate pegs."
