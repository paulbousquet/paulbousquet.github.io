  - title: Uncovering Nonlinearities with Regression Anatomy 
    abstract: "Kolesár and Plagborg-Møller (2024) show (i) even under an arbitrarily complex data generating process, linear regression frameworks can estimate a weighted average of marginal effects (ii) previous, more involved efforts to directly estimate non-linear effects produce flawed inference. The price of a vanilla regression's lack of sensitivity is a black box: a single point estimate cannot reveal where and to what extent nonlinearities exist. I show how to exploit the mechanics of least-squares regression and develop specifications to jointly test if marginal effects have sign and size dependence. Using monetary policy shocks as an application, I find persistent nonlinearities in US data that cannot be replicated by a New Keynesian model with asymmetric rigidities in price and wage setting."

  - title: Sticky Interest Rates
    abstract: "Central banks choose to adjust their target on overnight lending rates at a sluggish frequency that logistical costs alone cannot account for. Similar to earlier work on firm price-setting, this paper takes the infrequent adjustment at face value, abstracting from the reasons central bank make this choice, and instead asking what would be the consequences of this practice in a typical framework. I augment an otherwise standard New Keynesian model with interest rate analogues to Calvo and Rotemberg price stickiness and find marked differences in monetary policy transmission relative to a standard Taylor Rule benchmark. The effects mirror documented volatility associated with interest rate pegs."
